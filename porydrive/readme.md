# PoryDrive 2.0 (more fun one)

## Keyboard Input:
ESCAPE = Focus/Unfocus Mouse Look
F = FPS to console
P = Player stats to console
O = Toggle auto drive

## Mouse Input:

## How to play:
Drive around and "collect" Porygon, each time you collect a Porygon a new one will randomly spawn somewhere on the map. A Porygon colliding with a purple cube will cause it to light up blue, this can help you find them. Upon right clicking the mouse you will switch between Ariel and Close views, in the Ariel view it is easier to see which of the purple cubes that the Porygon is colliding with.
